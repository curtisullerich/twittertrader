As businesses seek to discover public opinion about their business or products, Twitter is one source for mining this information. Tweets present interesting classification challenges due to their irregular formatting and relatively small number of features. Tweet selection by keyword filtering often suffers from an high accuracy and low recall, or low accuracy and high recall. Using machine learning for text classification can improve this. We aim to survey a variety of text processing steps, focusing on the effects of tokenization, to increase accuracy of classification using a Naive Bayes classifier. We use a broad set of keywords with the goal of collecting a superset of the Tweets about a particular company (Apple, in this case) and train a binary classifier to filter out false positives.\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\nWe have built several reusable Java components that extend the Mallet API for processing of data from Twitter. We created a TweetJsonIterator that accepts a file of Twitter's JSON-formatted tweets and creates training Instances containing their values for easy processing during model training. We have implemented several Pipes that can be reused or easily modified to suit a similar Twitter processing purpose. These include FixEmoticons, Link2Title, Stemmer, SpellCheck, and Tokenize, which serves as a more extensible tokenizer than Mallet's default. To use these components, download an archive of our code using the link above, or clone our git repo.\r\nWe also provide a [corpus of 115,000 tweets](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3942841/100000appleTweets.txt) selected by Apple-related keyword and our [labeled data set of 2000 tweets](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3942841/appleBinaryFiltered.txt). The [bash scripts used to filter the data](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3942841/filters.sh) for near-duplicates and spam are also available for download.","note":"Don't delete this file!
